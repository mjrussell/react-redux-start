# react-redux-start

### Yet another starter kit for react. This one includes the following:

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
- [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux)
- [React-Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)
- [Redux-Router](https://github.com/rackt/redux-router)
- [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) with Live Reloading
- [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest)

### Buidling:

Install the dependencies:

`npm install`

Start the hot reloading:

`npm start`

Run the tests:

`npm test`

(Note you may need Node V4+ in order run the tests, otherwise bump jest down to 4.x)
